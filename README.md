# Image_Processing_Project
The project is based on training and testing the data using Convolution neural network. It is easy and simple to run the code step by step.  In this, i have used Cifar-10 dataset which is easily downloaded via internet. firstly, import all libararies which is used in this project and then download the Cifar-10 dataset. Next step, is defining the class name of dataset images and display all images which is in dataset. Furthermore, i have done normalizing the values which is lies in between 0 and 1.  After that, i have all applied the CNN layers such as CONV2D, MAXpooling, Flatten and Dense layer and activation function and compile the data with ADAM optimizer. After applying the layers and compiled the data i have done train the data on 20 Epochs which i got 92.25 accurcy than, evalute the model where i plotted the accuracy against the Epochs.
